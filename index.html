                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>In 1925, John Thomas Scopes, a high school teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, was accused of violating the state's Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of evolution in public schools. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the validity of the act and offered to defend anyone accused of teaching evolution. Scopes agreed to be the defendant in the trial. The case, popularly referred to as the Scopes Monkey Trial, increased the attention in the debate between science and religion in the United States.</p>

                <h2>Key Figures</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>John Scopes</strong>: The defendant, a high school teacher accused of teaching evolution. Scopes was a young and relatively inexperienced teacher who had been recruited to challenge the Butler Act by local businessmen and civic leaders eager to bring attention to their small town.</li>
                    <li><strong>George Rappleyea</strong>: The local businessman who convinced Scopes to challenge the Butler Act. Rappleyea, a New Yorker who had moved to Dayton, saw the trial as an opportunity to put Dayton on the map and increase profits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarence Darrow</strong>: Renowned defense attorney who represented Scopes. Darrow was one of the most famous lawyers in America, known for his defense of unpopular causes and his opposition to the death penalty. His involvement in the trial brought national attention and highlighted the legal battle between science and religion.</li>
                    <li><strong>William Jennings Bryan</strong>: Three-time presidential candidate who assisted the prosecution. Bryan was a leading figure in the anti-evolution movement and had very conservative bible beliefs.</li>

                <h2>Trial Details</h2>
                <h3>Opening Statements</h3>
                <p>On July 10, 1925, the trial began. The defense argued for the right to academic freedom and the importance of teaching scientific theories. Darrow emphasized that the trial was about more than just the guilt of one man; it was about the right to think and learn freely. The prosecution, with William Jennings Bryan, focused on the legality of the Butler Act and the importance of adhering to traditional religious values. Bryan argued that the state had the right to control the curriculum in public schools and that teaching evolution was constitutional.</p>

                <h3>Witness Testimonies</h3>
                <p>The trial included testimonies from both sides. Expert witnesses for the defense included scientists who testified about the validity of evolutionary theory. However, the judge ruled most of this testimony inadmissible, limiting the defense's arguments. This decision was a significant blow to Darrow's strategy, as he had hoped to use the trial to educate the public about evolution. Bryan, on the other hand, emphasized a literal interpretation of the Bible and called witnesses who supported the creationist view.</p>

                <h3>Darrow and Bryan's Debate</h3>
                <p>One of the most dramatic moments was when Clarence Darrow called William Jennings Bryan to the stand as an expert on the Bible. Darrow attempted to undermine the theory of the bible and prove that it can be used as scientific evidence. Bryan's inability to convincingly answer some of Darrow's questions was seen by many as a turning point in the trial.</p>

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>
                <p>On July 21, 1925, the jury found John Scopes guilty of teaching evolution, and he was fined $100. However, the trial's impact extended far beyond the courtroom. National debate was created due to this case and caused a lot of new discussions in Ameirca. While the conviction was later overturned on a technicality, the Butler Act remained in effect until it was repealed in 1967.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>The Scopes Trial had a lasting impact on American society. It brought attention to the debate over evolution and influenced future legal battles. The trial's legacy continues to shape discussions on academic freedom and the separation of church and state. In the years following the trial, several states enacted laws similar to the Butler Act, although many were eventually repealed or struck down by the courts. </p>
